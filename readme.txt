I have used cypress to automate the tests according to details present in google docs.
	Prerequisites:
	1. node.js
	2. npm
	3. cypress-xpath

thats it.
Install cypress and setup e2e testing and you are good to go. the tests are in cypress/e2e/tests.
Each module mentioned in the test plan file i.e Test.xlsx in the root directory. I have written and automated what was possible in the given time. Hope you like it.

Link to Test.xlsx in google sheets: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sjSebvVpJSiujXN9Pekd3evkzZFzeZgo7b3lpQjop2I/edit?usp=sharing

Hoping to speak to you soon.
